# face_emotion_recognition
ðŸŽ­ Face Emotion Recognition using Deep Learning and OpenCV This project detects real-time facial emotions through a webcam using a trained Keras model, OpenCV for face detection, and a Tkinter GUI for display. It identifies emotions like Happy, Sad, Angry, Surprise, and more.


# ðŸŽ­ Face Emotion Recognition

This is a real-time Face Emotion Recognition project built using Deep Learning, OpenCV, and Tkinter. The application detects a user's facial emotion through the webcam and displays it on screen with a fullscreen dark-themed GUI.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- Real-time face detection using Haar Cascade
- Emotion prediction using a trained Keras model
- Detects 7 emotions: Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Sad, Surprised, Neutral
- Simple and user-friendly GUI using Tkinter

## ðŸ’» Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- OpenCV
- Tkinter
- NumPy
- Pillow (PIL)

## ðŸš€ How to Run


   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Riteshd1137/face_emotion_recognition.git
   cd face_emotion_recognition

ðŸ“¸ Output
The application will launch a fullscreen window. Once you click Start Video, the webcam feed will display and detect your facial emotion in real-time.


ðŸ¤– Model Info
Model trained on 48x48 grayscale images from a facial expression dataset.

Replaceable with your own trained model if needed.
